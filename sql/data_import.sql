MPCE LEGACY DATA IMPORT SCRIPT

AUTHOR: Michael Falk

Over the years, FBTEE has accreted numerous different datasets, which have
been formatted in different ways. Different experiments have been made
to define general table structures that would apply across all datasets.

Now the time has come to prune and consolidate all these datasets, to make
a lean and interpretable database for production. This script grabs the
data from the draft 'manuscripts' database, and ports it across to the new
'mpce' database.

Some notes:
-	We should split up the sale of privilege from stock sales, because the copies
	are expressed in decimal values, while sales of privilege are expressed as
	fractions
-	The string describing each unit should be replaced with a reference to the
	new 'unit' table
-	The person data needs to be consolidated first, as for other tables
